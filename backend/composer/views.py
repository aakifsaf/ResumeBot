        **Goal:** Generate an ATS-optimized, tailored resume for a specific job application, based on the provided user profile and job description.

        **User Profile:**
        ```json
        {profile_data}
        ```

        **Job Description:**
        ```text
        {jd.raw_text}
        ```

        **Instructions:**
            1. **ATS Optimization:** 
            - Prioritize keywords from the job description (skills, tools, certifications).
            - Use standard section headers (e.g., "Work Experience," "Projects," "Skills").
            - Avoid graphics/tables to ensure ATS readability.

            2. **Content Generation:**
            - **Professional Summary (3-4 sentences):** 
                - Highlight years of experience, core competencies, and alignment with the jobâ€™s mission.
                - Example: *"Results-driven [Job Title] with [X] years of experience in [Key Skill 1] and [Key Skill 2], seeking to leverage [Achievement] at [Target Company]."*

            - **Work Experience (STAR Method):**
                - For each role, generate 2-3 bullet points using: 
                - **Situation/Task:** Brief context.
                - **Action:** Strong action verbs (*Optimized, Led, Implemented*).
                - **Result:** Quantifiable outcomes (*"Improved performance by 30%"*).
                - Example: *"Led a cross-functional team to migrate legacy systems to AWS, reducing downtime by 40%."*

            - **Projects Section:**
                - Include 1-2 projects relevant to the job. For each:
                - **Title:** Project name + timeframe.
                - **Description:** Problem solved, tools used, and measurable impact.
                - Example: *"Inventory Management System (Python/Django, 2023): Developed a cloud-based system reducing stock discrepancies by 25%."*

            - **Skills (Categorized):**
                - Group into: *Technical Skills (Programming, Tools), Soft Skills, Certifications*.
                - Match exact terms from the job description (e.g., "React" vs. "JavaScript").

            3. **Formatting Rules:**
            - Use Markdown headers (## Work Experience, ### Projects).
            - Bold key achievements (**$2M cost savings**).
            - Keep bullets concise (1 line each).

        **Output:**
        Generate only the tailored resume content as requested above. Do not include greetings or introductory phrases.
